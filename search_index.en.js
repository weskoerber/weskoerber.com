My favorite programming language is C.\nContact\n\nGithub: https://github.com/weskoerber\nGitlab: https://gitlab.com/weskoerber\nLinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/weskoerber\nEmail: wes@weskoerber.com\n\n1\nThe more I learn, the less I feel like I know.

Its collection of completion\nsources allows\nextending its functionality into many domains quite easily. It's a very useful\nplugin and it worked very well for me, and it was one of the main reasons I\nswitched to (and stuck with) Neovim.\nHowever, as time went on, I found myself using nvim-cmp less for its\nintended purpose and more for use cases that are better solved with other\nplugins and workflows. I found that in trying to shoehorn nvim-cmp into\nseveral different tools, my overall productivity diminished. In this post,\nI'll explain why I'm disabling nvim-cmp (maybe), what I'll use in its place,\nand how doing so will be of benefit in the long run.\nHow I use nvim-cmp\nI realized that my main use of nvim-cmp was for API discovery, especially in\nlanguages with namespaces (e.g. C++, C#, Zig). I often found myself begin\ntyping a line by resolving further into the namespace and paging through the\nlist of symbols to see if it had what I wanted. If it did, then I would accept\nthe suggestion and move forward; if it didn't, I would \"back out\" or \"go up\" a\nlevel in the namespace heirarchy, and try again. Using Zig as an example:\nstd.fs.&lt;...&gt;, std.fs.Dir.&lt;...&gt;, std.fs.path.&lt;...&gt;... and so on, until I\nfound what I was looking for. Once I found it, I could continue with the next\n\"token\" in my \"stream\" of conciousness.\nHowever, if I knew exactly what symbol I wanted and exactly where to find\nit, I didn't really use nvim-cmp. For example, using std.debug.print in Zig\nor std::cout in C++ (or printf, even), I rarely relied on nvim-cmp for\ncompletions. I found that it was quicker for me (and less disruptive) to just\ntype the symbol, letter-by-letter.\nI am not the fastest typer, either. If I had to guess, I would say I type at\naround 70-80 words per minute for English prose (such as this blog post,\nemails--\"normal\" communication with other humans). That number is lower when\nwriting code. It's difficult to equate the two, since English prose is measured\nin words per minute, whereas writing code is measured in symbols per minute\n(probably.. I don't know, just a guess), which for me is probably anywhere from\n20-40 percent slower 1.\nWhatever the case may be, it feels a lot faster to just type the exact symbol\nI need instead of using nvim-cmp to help. Crucially, it feels even faster to\ntype the following symbol because my train of thought hasn't been interrupted.\nFor example, typing std.deb&lt;C-y&gt;.pri&lt;C-y&gt; feels slower than typing\nstd.debug.print (&lt;C-y&gt; is my completion-accept key).\n\nWhat will I use instead?\nOf course, I still have a desire for API discoverability and documentation from\nwithin Neovim. If nvim-cmp no longer provides this, I'll need some\nalternatives. Recently, I've been giving\nTelescope a heavier\nworkload, particularly leveraging  its\nTreesitter integration\nTelescope\nTelescope can show all symbols in a buffer or a workspace. These symbols can be\nfiltered through them using the familiar Telescope interface, add them to the\nquickfix list, show a preview of the selection, and so on. This method for API\ndiscoverability is much more powerful. Most of the time, the documentation\nnvim-cmp shows comes from the LSP, which in turn gets it from doc-comments in\nthe source code 2. Using Telescope's preview, or even putting the result in\nthe quickfix list and opening the source in a new buffer allows a much better\nexperience to read source code and comments within it.\nThis leads us to my next point: reading the source code is often the best way\nto get accurate and up-to-date documentation.\n\nSource code\nIf your language or library provides source code and you're not reading it,\nyou're doing yourself a disservice. It's often the best way to figure out what\na particular API does. More often than not, documentation in the form of\ncomments is outdated, and could lead you down a rabbit hole. Documentation\nthat's hosted on the web is worse, even if it is autogenerated from comments in\nthe code. Often times the code is updated, but the author forgets to update the\ndoc-comment (hi, it's me, I'm author). This is avoidable if you just read the\ncode!\nThis is not always an option, though. For example, the C standard library that's\ninstalled on your distribution only provides header files, not\nimplementations (unless you clone the library, of course). And for languages\nlike C#, you actually need to decompile the runtime to get source code--wild.\nGrep\nDo not underestimate the power of grep. In languages like C, it can be\ndifficult to navigate through header files, especially if they're nested and\ninter-dependent. This is where grep makes it easy. If you're looking for a\nparticular symbol, or some verbiage you think may lead you to the symbol, and\nyou're not sure which header file it's in, you can pull one of these:\n\nAutomatic includes\nSupported language servers an also automatically include the header or namespace\nthat contains a symbol you're looking for. For example,\nclangd will automatically include\nstdio.h if it sees printf in your file.\nAll of these workflows is something nvim-cmp cannot provide--it is just not\ndesigned for this.\nMan pages\nTelescope also provides support for searching for man pages, and Neovim has\nfirst-class support for rendering man pages. This makes it a breeze to find\ndetailed documentation on a topic. The information in the man pages is often\ndense, but succinct. They may also contain links to relevant pages, which\nNeovim can follow by default.\nFor API discoverability and documentation that's available without an internet\nconnection (or even if you don't want to open up a browser), man pages are hard\nto beat. I love it when libraries and tools ship with man pages, but sadly, this\nseems like a dying practice.\nStreamlining stream-of-conciousness\nOne of the main goals of disabling nvim-cmp is to optimize the way I approch\nwriting code. Instead of trying to discover an API and read its documentation\nin-band with writing code, I want to separate the two. I want to find ways to\nreduce the amount of noise and distraction while writing code. I want to know\nthe API before I use it, not get to know it while I'm using it.\nInstead of breaking my train of thought mid-line, I should be able to plow\nthrough it knowing exactly what I need. How far this goes, I'm not sure. Just\na single expression? Maybe. A whole line? Possibly. A single scope? That would\nbe nice. An entire function? Sweet.\nI may not end up removing nvim-cmp entirely. There are sill some use-cases\nthat don't conflict with this thesis. For example, path completion is wonderful\nand doesn't conflict at all with writing code.\nI'm on the fence about snippets. Usually, when you need a snippet, you know\nexactly what you're getting. The std snippet for Zig converts std to const std = @import(\"std\");. It's hard to make an argument that this is not a boost\nin efficiency.\nClosing thoughts\nIn general, I see much more productivity when I can turn on some music, put my\nhead down, and go goblin-mode for as long as I can manage before being\ninterrupted by encountering an obstacle, such as needing to find just the right\nfunction. If I can separate reading documentation from writing code, I should be\nable to sustain these bouts for much longer, resulting in more productivity,\nbetter large-scale thought cohesion, and, honestly, a more enjoyable experience.\nAfter all, writing code should be fun, and reading documentation just takes the\nfun right out of it.\n\n1\nLots of ballpark, anectdotal, pulling-it-out-my-you-know-what numbers\nhere.\n\n2\nThere are some notable exceptions here, such as C#.\n\n","id":"https://www.weskoerber.com/posts/blog/disabling-autocomplete/","title":"Why I'm disabling editor autocomplete"},"https://www.weskoerber.com/posts/blog/hello/":{"body":"A brief introduction\nWhen I launched this site about a year ago, I wanted an easy-to-use static site\ngenerator that took Markdown source content and a theme that looked clean,\nminimal, and had a dark theme toggle.

These\ndays there are so many libraries for creating great utilities from TUIs to\nsimple argument parsers. It also helps that the POSIX and GNU standards for\ncommand line arguments is damn near ubiquitous - hell, even Microsoft adopted\nthem\n1. However, I find that command line utilities are lacking in some areas. In\nthis post, I'll explore some areas I think need improvement, and suggest some\nalternatives.\nPipelines\nPipelines are used heavily in\nUnix-like operating systems, and is often what makes it stand out. Instead of\ncreating large, clunky, and complicated applications that try to implement every\nfeature the authors can think of, the philosophy of Unix is to implement the\nmost basic functionality, and use other programs to perform some further\noperations.\nWhen running command line applications, the output of the application is\ntypically formatted in a way that makes it easily readable by humans. This\nusually takes the form of a table, grid, or list. This is great for us humans,\nas it's easy for our brains to read and interpret at a quick glance. But that's\nnot easiest for a machine to parse 2. Sure, there's many great utilities like\nawk, sed, and grep, but I think there's a better way.\nWhen a command-line application runs, it could detect whether its stdout is a\nterminal device or some other handle. For example, stdout could be connected\nto stdin of another program, in which case it would be a pipe. Applications\ncould detect this and determine the output format to use.\nEvery application has its own way of outputting data. Look at the lsblk and\nls commands. They're both tabular data, but you would need to implement\nparsing logic twice - once for each command. If you have to run many commands,\nhaving individual parsing logic for each becomes time-consuming and clutters the\nactual purpose of your application. Instead, applications should be able to\noutput data in a format that other utilities can accept easily that minimizes\nthe effort required to extract data.\nFor example, if the application's stdout is a terminal, it could output its\nresults in a tabular format. But when stdout is a pipe, maybe it could output\nits results in some sort of structured text format, such as JSON. This would\nenable the use of jq to parse the output easily. Or maybe you can send the\nJSON data to some other environment. Since most languages have libraries that\ncan parse JSON, integration is trivial.\nThere should still be options for overriding this behavior though, since one\nuse-case could be piping results to a pager to view and navigate a high volume\nof output more easily. In this case, since the application's stdout is a pipe\nconnected to the pager's stdin, the application would output JSON, but we want\nthe tabular format. Here we could explicitly tell the application we want the\ntabular output style with an option, such as --output-style=tabular.\nThe client -&gt; server model\nIn the world of Unix-like operating systems, a pattern you'll see implemented\noften for applications is to have a daemon process which implements the\napplication's business logic and listens for input via IPC (socket, pipe, shared\nmemory, etc), and a small command-line utility that talks to the daemon process\nover this IPC channel. There are many utilities that use this pattern:\n\nmakoctl -&gt; mako (repo)\nnmcli -&gt; NetworkManager (repo)\nswaymsg -&gt; sway (repo)\nwpctl -&gt; wireplumber (repo)\nMost of systemd, such as:\n\njournalctl -&gt; systemd-journald\nloginctl -&gt; systemd-logind\nnetworkctl -&gt; systemd-networkd\n\n\n\nI think this pattern works really well, because it separates the actual logic of\nthe application and the user interface. It also works really well cross-platform\ntoo, particularly on Windows, since services are a special type of application\nthat is non-interactive. It also simplifies environments where you may have\nmultiple users. You only need one daemon process, but you are able to have many\nclient processes talking to the daemon over the IPC channel. Several other\naspects of the application are easier to control and manages, such as access\ncontrol, daemon lifetime management, logging, etc.\nOf course, this is just not the right pattern for some applications. For\nexample, the ls command doesn't need to be this complex. A much more\nappropriate invocation strategy is the one-shot method (the way it's currently\nimplemented), where the application launches, it processes its input, does some\nstuff, then exits.\nExit codes and error messages\nMost of the time, when applications quit due to an error, the error code is 1.\nHowever, there may be many reasons for an application to terminate unexpectedly.\nHow is a user supposed to differentiate between different conditions not being\nmet, errors with input, etc? For example, if a program terminates because a file\ndoesn't exist, how can the user of the application differentiate that between\ntermination due to an invalid option? In my opinion, each error code should\ncorrespond to a particular condition. I really don't like the idea of \"unknown\"\nor \"generic\" errors. Most of the time, these errors are not \"unknown\" or\n\"generic\", the author is just too lazy to specifically identify them. Error\nmessages typically take the burden of identifying specific errors by emitting a\nmessage to stderr. This isn't easy for applications to parse, since the error\nmessages are often formatted with some input from the user.\nError messages in another area that can be improved. Applications such as code\ncompilers have pretty good error messages. The messages are good enough that\nthey often tell you the exact source of the problematic line, and sometimes even\nthe problematic character (such as a missing semi-colon). Rust is the gold\nstandard for compiler errors. We should take a page out of its book and apply it\nto our command line applications.\nMan pages\nThis one is subjective, but I love man pages. Finding help in a man page is so\nmuch quicker than googling, and you don't have to search several links to find\nwhat you need. Just man my_application and you have everything you need to\nknow. Applications commonly give you man pages for the usage and purpose of the\napplication. I really like when applications provide man pages for configuration\nfiles (e.g. man 5 gitignore). I think more applications should do this.\n1\nJust to be clear, POSIX doesn't strictly define long options (i.e.\n--option=value, --option value, or --option), but long options are not\ninherently incompatible with POSIX-compliant systems.\n\n2\nWhat I mean here really is that it's not the easiest to write utilities\nthat parse the output. Optimal machine parsing would be binary data, not\ntext streams.\n\n","id":"https://www.weskoerber.com/posts/blog/stdout-formatting-options/","title":"Writing better CLI applications"},"https://www.weskoerber.com/posts/blog/stm32-zig-1/":{"body":"Introduction\nI've been using Zig a\nlot\nover the past few months writing wide variety of projects. From\nkewpie, a simple query string parser,\nto dirtstache, a\nMustache implementation -- even a\nlibcurl wrapper with\nzig-curl -- I have experience with\nZig across a wide range of domains.\nHowever, I've always wanted to use Zig on an embedded target. On paper, Zig is\nan excellent choice for embedded programming: no implicit allocations, no\nhidden control flow, seamless integration with the C ABI, a fantastic build\nsystem1, etc. However, that's on paper. I wanted to see for myself if the\nadvertised strengths of Zig held up when put to the test, especially in a\nresource-constrained embedded environment.\nWell, I did just that. In this post I'll retrace my steps in how I went from an\nempty main.zig to printing Hello, World! to my terminal.\nGoals\nBefore writing any Zig code, I set some goals for this project in order to\nmaximize my learning potential:\n\nNo dependencies\n100% Zig code\nA 3-day time limit\n\nWhat we're working with\nHardware\nI have a few Cortex-M4 development boards laying around: an\nMSP432P4\n(RIP),\na NUCLEO-F4, and a\nNUCLEO-L4. For\nthis experiment, I decided to go with the NUCLEO-F4 for no reason other than it\nwas sitting closest to me at the time.\nThe process is quite similar for other Cortex-M4-based MCUs, so feel free to\nfollow along with your own hardware. The peripherals on your device may vary,\nso consult your device's reference manual.\nSoftware\nFlash programming\nYou'll need a way to flash the code to your MCU. I'm using\nOpenOCD to flash mine. However, there are several other\nutilities out there you may choose from.\nCompiler and binary utilities\nI'm using Zig master version 0.14.0-dev.1632+d83a3f174, installed via\nzvm. Note that this version is in\ndevelopment and has some planned breaking\nchanges,\nso this may not work in the future.\nIn addition to the Zig compiler (and its suite of binary utilities), the GNU\nbinutils will help us out immensely if\nthings go wrong. Notably, Zig doesn't ship with\nnm or\nobjdump\nutilities. I strongly recommend installing the GCC toolchain for\nARM before\ncontinuing.\nLiterature\nYou'll absolutely need the documentation on your MCU, unless you're some\nsuperhuman that's memorized everything. At the very least, you'll need:\n\nMCU reference manual\nCortex-M4 reference manual\nDevice-specific datasheet\nDevelopment board user manual\n\nGetting started\nI was excited. I finally sat down and was ready to make some LEDs blink. I\ncreated my project and an empty build.zig and main.zig with an empty while\nloop:\n\nmain.zig:\n\nBuild my thing\nThe first logical step here was to get something to build. Since we know\nwe're only going to run this code on a Cortex-M4 MCU, we can hard-code the\ntarget field using\nb.resolveTargetQuery\ninstead of using the usual\nb.standardTargetOptions.\n\nAfter running zig build, stm32-test was put in zig-out/bin:\n\nTheoretically, we could flash this to the MCU right now, but it wouldn't work.\nConvert ELF to binary\nI said that flashing the ELF file we created in the previous step won't work.\nLet's dive into why it won't work.\nThe Cortex-M4 doesn't know about the ELF file format. It loads\nprograms in a very specific way, and just executes instructions sequentially.\nIn my case, the STM32F4 has a few different boot modes but we'll stick with the\ndefault -- booting from main flash memory. The reference manual says this about\nbooting:\n\n[T]he CPU fetches the top-of-stack value from address 0x0000 0000, then\nstarts code execution from the boot memory starting from 0x0000 0004.\n\nWe won't get too deep into the startup process here. It's covered in Cortex M4\nstartup.\nThe first 4 bytes of the ELF file header are 7f 45 4c 46. If we flashed\nthis to the MCU, it would fetch this value and set it to the stack pointer,\nthen start executing spurious instructions. Who knows what would happen in this\ncase. At best, an invalid instruction execution causes an interrupt that resets\nthe MCU. Additionally, the ELF file contains other non-binary data, such as\ndebug sympols, section tables, etc. We don't want the MCU interpreting these\ndata as instructions, so we'll need to convert to a different format.\nThis is where objcopy comes into play. We'll convert our ELF file into a\nBIN file. objcopy's man page says this:\n\nobjcopy can be used to generate a raw binary file by using an output target\nof ‘binary’ (e.g., use -O binary). When objcopy generates a raw binary file,\nit will essentially produce a memory dump of the contents of the input object\nfile. All symbols and relocation information will be discarded. The memory\ndump will start at the load address of the lowest section copied into the\noutput file.\n\nThis is what we want -- raw instructions and data to flash onto the MCU. Zig\nships with an implementation of objcopy. Let's update our build.zig file to\nconvert the ELF file into a binary file:\n\nAfter re-running zig build, we now get stm32-test.bin alongside\nstm32-test in zig-out/bin. Sweet!\nMemory map and linking\nWe can avoid this topic no longer. We must now talk about linking and the\nmemory map.\nEmbedded devices typically have small amounts of flash and SRAM. My STM32F401RE\nhas 512K of flash and 92K of SRAM. In addition to flash and data memory, the\nCortex-M4 has memory-mapped peripherals. Even though the amount flash and\ndata memory is small, the address space is quite large with 4G of addressable\nmemory.\nFirst, lets take a look at how the linker put our ELF together:\n\nNote two key headings in the output of objdump: VMA and LMA. GNU's ld has a\ngreat description of VMA and LMA, so I'll let them do the talking:\n\nEvery loadable or allocatable output section has two addresses. The first is\nthe VMA, or virtual memory address. This is the address the section will have\nwhen the output file is run. The second is the LMA, or load memory address.\nThis is the address at which the section will be loaded. In most cases the\ntwo addresses will be the same. An example of when they might be different is\nwhen a data section is loaded into ROM, and then copied into RAM when the\nprogram starts up (this technique is often used to initialize global\nvariables in a ROM based system). In this case the ROM address would be the\nLMA, and the RAM address would be the VMA.\n\nIn other words, LMA is the physical address in the MCU's memory, whereas VMA is\nthe address within the MCU's memory map.\nWe need to tell the linker how to lay out each section of our ELF file so\nthat we can flash it to the target and ensure it executes the instructions we\nwant it to. In order to do this, we'll need a custom linker script.\nLinker script\nThere are so many good resources out there regarding linker scripts. I will\nonly briefly explain the parts of the linker script as it relates to the\nCortext-M4. If you want more in-depth information on linker scripts, refer to\nthe references below.\nBefore we get started, let's tell Zig to use this linker script:\n\nMemory Regions\nWe need to tell our linker about the memory layout of our target. We do so\nusing the\nMEMORY\nkeyword:\n\nHere, we define our flash as a 512K region of read-only memory beginning at\naddress 0x0800_0000 and our sram as a 92K region of read-write memory\nbeginning at address 0x2000_0000. We'll use the STACK_SIZE variable later.\nEntry point\nThe linker needs an entry point. Let's define our entry point as the first vector in our vector table, resetHandler (see vector table below):\n\nSections\nNext we define the layout of our output file with the\nSECTIONS\nkeyword:\n\n.text section\n\nQuite a lot is happening here. Let's break it down line-by-line:\n\nalign the .text section on a 4-byte boundary\nreserve 4-bytes at the start of the .text section for the initial stack pointer\nplace the vector table immediatly after our initial stack pointer\nplace the code following the reset vectors\nplace read-only data after the code\nalign the end of the .text section on a 4-byte boundary\n\n.stack section\nNext comes the stack section. We'll reserve spack for our stack using the\nSTACK_SIZE variable we created earlier. Note that the ARM Procedure Call\nStandard\n(AAPCS)\nsays that the stack must be double word (8-byte) aligned, not single word\n(4-byte).\n\n\nalign the bottom of the stack on an 8-byte boundary\nreserve space for stack defined by STACK_SIZE\nalign the top of the stack on an 8-byte boundary\nset the __initial_stack_pointer to the current position\n\n.data section\n\n\nalign the .data section on a 4-byte boundary\ndefine a symbol _sdata that marks the start of the .data section\nplace initialized data in the output file\ndefine a symbol _edata that marks the end of the .data section\nalign the .data section on a 4-byte boundary\ndefine a symbol _ldata that holds the LMA of our .data section\n\nNote the last part &gt; sram AT&gt; flash. This tells the linker that we want to\nput the data in the sram region of memory, but we're going to load it from\nthe flash region. This is important for understanding what happens before\nmain().\n.bss section\n\n\nalign the .bss section on a 4-byte boundary\ndefine a symbol _szero that marks the start of the .bss section\nplace initialized data in the output file\ndefine a symbol _ezero that marks the end of the .bss section\nthe .bss section on a 4-byte boundary\n\nReferences: 2 3\nThe vector table\nIn the previous section, we put the vector table (.vectors) at the start of\nthe .text section preceded only by the 4-byte initial stack pointer. Let's\ndefine our vector table in Zig:\n\nHere, we create our vector table, which is an array of function pointers having\nthe signature:\n\nEach index in the array corresponds to an interrupt vector. The elements\ncontaining null values are reserved. The first 15 bytes of this table will be\nidentical across all Cortex-M4 MCUs. After that, each MCU will have its own\norder for device-specific interrupts.\nThe linksection(\".vectors\") tells the linker that we want to put this\ndeclaration in the .vectors section of the file. This is analogous to\n__attribute__((section(\".vectors\"))) in GCC.\nCortex-M4 startup\nNow that we told the linker where to put our code, let's talk about why we put\nit there. Recall the quote from the datasheet in the Convert ELF to\nbinary section:\n\n[T]he CPU fetches the top-of-stack value from address 0x0000 0000, then\nstarts code execution from the boot memory starting from 0x0000 0004.\n\nWhen the MCU boots up, the first thing it does is fetch the value at address\n0x0000_0000 and uses it as its stack pointer. There are a couple of\ninteresting things to note here. First, the address 0x0000_0000 is aliased to\n0x0800_0000 (see footnote 4 for more info). This means that our\n__initial_stack_pointer we put at 0x0800_0000 is accessible also from\n0x0000_0000.\nAfter our stack pointer is loaded, the MCU proceeds to 0x0000_0004 and starts\nexecuting instructions.\nLet's take a closer look at our output file. First, let's check out the section table:\n\nHere, we see:\n\n.text section starting at 0x0800_0000 corresponding with the start of the flash region\n.stack section starting at 0x2000_0000 corresponding with the start of the sram region and having a length of 0x800\n.data section starting immediately after our .stack section\n.bss section starting immediately after our .data section\n\n\nHere, we see the value 20000800, which corresponds to the top of our stack.\nThis is the __initial_stack_pointer we reserved in the .text section and\ndefined in the .stack section of our linker script. The following few\naddresses are our interrupt vectors that were placed in the .text section.\nHow cool is that!\nWhat happens before main()?\nWhen we compile an application on our PCs, we might assume that the entry point\nfor the application is the main() function. If you assumed that, you're half\nright. The main function is the entry point your application, but that's\nnot what the operating system calls. The operating system calls the _start()\nfunction, which is usually provided by your libc.\nWhen you build a C/C++ application for Linux, your system's libc implementation\nis implicitly linked to your application, which includes a piece of code called\nthe \"startup code\". The startup code does things like initilize argc and\nargv, call constructors, and so on. I won't get into too much detail here.\nInstead, check out the references below for some deep-dives.\nEven though we set our entry point above, we'll still need to\ndefine our _start() symbol, otherwise the linker complains at us. Let's add the following to our main.zig:\n\nWe implement an exported _start() function that just calls main(). If main\nreturns (which it shouldn't), we'll just hang in an infinite loop.\nHere's what code got generated:\n\nAwesome, we made it to main()! You'd expect this to work once flashed to the\nMCU, right? Well, you're in for disappointment. Review the Cortex-M4 startup\nprocess: we fetch the stack pointer and begin executing instructions at\n0x0000_0004, which is our reset handler. However, our reset handler doesn't\ndo anything, so main will never be called.\nIn order to fix this, resetHandler() needs to call _start():\n\nThat gives us the following:\n\nNow we can see that resetHandler() calls _start(), which calls main().\nAre we there yet? Technically, yes - but we still have work to do. If you're\nworking entirely on the stack and don't rely on preinitialized memory, you can\nget started, and even make an LED blink.\nHowever, in most cases, you'll want to load up your memory from the .data and\n.bss sections -- this is not done for you automatically like it is when you\nrun a program on your computer. Embedded startup code must explicitly perform\nthis step.\nTo do this, we'll need to refer back to the symbols we created in the linker script:\n\n_sdata: the start of the .data section\n_edata: the end of the .data section\n_ldata: the LMA of the .data section\n_szero: the start of the .bss section\n_ezero: the end of the .bss section\n\nFor our .bss section, we need to zero out all memory between _szero and\n_ezero. For the .data section, we need to copy the memory from _ldata\ninto the memory from _sdata to _edata. Let's do this in our _start() function:\n\nAnd there you have it! We've reached main! That's a lot of stuff happening\nunder the hood... Note that your startup code isn't limited to initilizing\nsystem memory. The possibilities are endless. One thing you might consider\nputting in your startup code is system clock setup. But that's outside the\nscope of this project, for now at least.\nReferences: 5 6\nFlashing\nAs I mentioned earlier, I'm using OpenOCD to flash the MCU. I created a step in build.zig that would do this for me:\n\nTo flash the MCU, all I need to do is zig build flash. The artifacts are\nrebuilt only when needed, and flashing is handled via the system command to\nopenocd.\nBlink a damn LED\nThe NUCLEO-F401RE development board has an LED wired up to GPIO PA5. Before\nanything else, the GPIO A clocks need to be enabled on the AHB1 bus. We do\nthis by setting the GPIOA EN bit in the RCC_AHB1ENR register. After that'\nwe're free to configure the GPIO pin as an output and toggle the ODR register\nto turn the LED on and off.\n\nHello, world!\nNext, we need to enable the UART. On my board, USART2 (GPIO PA2 &amp; PA3) is\nexposed over to the ST-Link. In rough steps, we need to do the following:\n\nenable APB1 bus clocks for USART2\nset GPIO mode to alternate function\nconfigure alternate function to USART2\nenable USART2\nconfigure the baud rate\nenable the transmitter\nsend data\n\nHere's what I came up with:\n\nAttaching to the serial port and flashing the code gives me what I want:\n\nConclusion\nIf you couldn't tell, I'm getting burned out writing this. This post has taken\nme the better part of a day. Even though it's somewhat laborious, I\naccomplished my goal of getting \"Hello, World!\" printed to my terminal from an\nembedded device without any dependencies within the time limit I imposed on\nmyself.\nThe code is not particularly readable, though. The register access is esoteric,\nand there's no documentation about what each value means. However, there are\nsome pretty elegant ways of solving that problem that I hope to share in a\nfollow-up post. However, that's all for today.\nZig has quickly become my favorite language since I picked it up back in\nFebruary when it was in 0.11.0. We're now in 0.13.0. So much has changed,\nand the 0.14.0-dev branch has seemingly more changes than ever. Since\n0.11.0, the language, its standard library, and its build system have seem\nmassive improvements. If you're looking to try out Zig, there's no better time\nthan now!.\n\n1\nI have a lot to say about the Zig build system.

To do this we can declare extern functions. For example,\nthe\nGetAdaptersAddresses\nfunction.\n\nNot so bad, right?\nOops I almost forgot:\nIP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES\nisn't defined yet. Let's add this real quick... Ok, maybe not - that's a lot of\nfields and a lot of typing.\nThankfully, Jonathan Marler created a binding\ngenerator appropriately named\nzigwin32 that generates Zig bindings\nfor Win32. We can fetch zigwin32 with Zig's built-in package manager and make\nit available to our build.zig script.\n\nAfter adding it to our exe's root_module, we can continue.\nmain.zig Skeleton\nFor a starting point, we'll create three functions: main, serviceMain, and\nserviceControl.\nOur main function is our entry point to our application. No surprises here.\nThe serviceMain and serviceControl functions will be called by the service\ncontrol manager. We'll get into the details of these functions a bit later, but\ntake note of their signatures and calling conventions.\n\nConnect to the service control manager\nOur service program may run several different services within one process. We\ncan define the services that run within our process as a service\ntable.\nEach entry in this table contains a string holding the service name and a\nfunction pointer that points to the service's entry point. In this case, it's\nour serviceMain function. Let's define the service table in our main\nfunction.\n\nAfter we define the services our process will run, we need to connect our\nservice program to the service control manager and tell it about our services.\nWe do this by calling\nStartServiceCtrlDispatcherA,\npassing the table we created in the previous step.\n\nNote that the call to StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA doesn't return until all\nservices within our service table are stopped, so we can just return after this\ncall. It is possible this function doesn't return for a very long time!\nInitialize the service\nAfter calling StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA and creating the connection, the\nservice control manager will call our serviceMain function we registered in\nthe table earlier.\nOnce we enter serviceMain, the service control manager needs to send events\nto our service. For example, in the services console in Windows, right-clicking\na service displays a menu with some actions: Start, Stop, Pause, Restart, etc.\nThese are all events that our service needs to handle. But before we handle\nanything, we need to tell the service control manager where to send its events.\nThis is where the serviceControl function comes in.\nPassing data between functions\nSince serviceMain doesn't directly call serviceControl, we need some way of\nsharing data between these two functions. One way is to create global variables\nthat the two functions can access. However, I really don't like global data,\nand try avoid it as much as possible.\nYou'll note that in the following section I choose to register our\nserviceControl function via RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerExA instead of\nRegisterServiceCtrlHandlerA. This is intentional. The former allows us to\npass in a pointer that gets forwarded to serviceMain.\nLet's create a simple ServiceData struct that we can provide to the control\nregistration.\n\nDon't worry too much about these fields for now, we'll get to them later.\nRegistering the control handler\nInside our serviceMain function we'll register the serviceControl function\nwith the service control manager, telling it to call this function when an\nevent is generated. We do this with the\nRegisterServiceCtrlHandlerExA\nfunction. We'll also pass the address of a default ServiceData struct.\n\nThis call returns a handle that we'll also need in serviceControl, so let's\nsave the handle to the status_handle variable.\nThread synchronization\nI hope I didn't scare you too badly with that section title, it's not that bad,\nI promise.\nOur process needs to stay open as long as our services are running. If we\nreturn from serviceMain, our process closes and we lose our services. This is\nnot what we want. You might be tempted to put a while (true) {} block at the\nend of serviceMain but that has its own problems I won't get into here.\nInstead, we'll create a waitable event using with\nCreateEventA.\nThis function will create a synchronization primitive that we can use as a\nsignaling mechanism to block the main thread until something happens. For now,\nlet's save this event object to the stop_event variable.\n\nUp and running\nWe now have everything we need to tell the service control manager we're\nrunning and ready to handle events. Let's make sure we assign the\nstatus_handle and stop_event we created in the previous steps to our\nServiceData struct.\n\nNext, let's set our ServiceData state to running and tell the service control\nmanager we'll handle stop and shutdown commands. We'll do this by updating the\ndwCurrentState and dwControlsAccepted fields in the  ServiceData.status\nwe just initialized. Then, we'll update the service control manager with this\nnew data with the\nSetServiceStatus\nfunction.\n\nFinally, we'll await a signal from the stop_event we created earlier to block\nthe process using\nWaitForSingleObject.\nSince this call is blocks until we signal the stop_event object, we can\nassume if we get past this our service was stopped and we can update our status\nwith the service control manager.\n\nHandling events\nNow that we've initialized our service and are blocking the process waiting for\nevents, we can get implement the serviceControl function that handles these\nevents.\nWe can retrieve our service_data pointer we passed previously by casting it\nto our ServiceData type. Also, we'll switch on the code, which is the event\nsent to us by the service control manager. Our service is pretty dumb, so we\nwon't have a lot of robust handling here. For now, we'll just return\nNO_ERROR.\n\nThe control handler\ndocumentation\nsays that we should return ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED if we don't handle an\nevent, and NO_ERROR for the SERVICE_CONTROL_INTERROGATE, event if we don't\nhandle it.\n\nNext, we'll handle the stop and shutdown events. When we handle these, we'll\nneed to make sure deinitialization happens properly either here in our control\nhandler or serviceMain. Remember, in the Up and running\nsection we created and awaited our stop event which is blocking our process. If\nwe never signaled the object, the process would never terminate. In order to\nsignal the event object, we'll use the\nSetEvent\nfunction.\n\nWrap up\nI hope this post was helpful in showing how to use Zig to create Windows\nservices. I just did the bare minimum here, but there's so much room for\nimprovement, starting with refactoring this code to read more like idiomatic\nZig code.\nIt's also nearly impossible to diagnose crashes. Logging would be a great\naddition as well.\nAlthough our service can be started, stopped, and restarted, doesn't really do\nanything. That's neither practical nor useful. However, the possibilities are\nendless.

It works by sending\nthe selected range to an external program's stdin, and replaces those lines\nwith its stdout.\nUsing an empty range\nSometimes you may want to put the contents of a file directly into you buffer,\nbut you don't want to open up the file in a separate buffer, yank the contents,\nand put them in your desired buffer.\nreadme.txt\n\nmy_buffer\n\nAfter switching to normal mode and navigating to the empty line (the last line\nin my_buffer), typing !!cat readme.txt will but the contents of\nreadme.txt into my buffer, starting at my cursor!\nmy_buffer\n\nReplacing a single line\nSometimes you want to view the content of a command's stdout in Vim. Usually\nwhat I do is run the command and pipe stdout into Vim's stdin (i.e. vim -).\nHere's an example using the !! command. Say you have a JSON file that's been\nminified and you\nwant to un-minify it. To accomplish this, we can use\njq to read the file and put it's formatted JSON output\ninto our buffer.\n\nAfter switching to Vim's normal mode and putting my cursor over the line with\nthe minified JSON, when I type !!jq&lt;CR&gt;, the single line of minified JSON is\nreplaced with multiple lines of perfectly-formatted JSON -- magic!\n\nReplacing a range\nHere's another contrived example. You have a list of strings and you need to\nsort them and edit them in a buffer. Let's ignore that Vim has a built-in sort\ncommand (:h sort), so we need to use sort from GNU coreutils. One way you\nmight accomplish this task is:\n\nsave the list of strings to a file\nrun GNU sort on the file, saving the output to a separate file\nopen the sorted file in Vim\nyank the sorted lines\nput the sorted lines into the desired location in your destination buffer\n\nThis is a pretty lengthy task. Maybe we can shorten it. How about we:\n\nsave the list of strings to a file\nrun GNU sort on the file, piping the output to Vim's stdin (vim -)\nyank the sorted lines\nput the sorted lines into the desired location in your destination buffer\n\nThat's better- we got rid of the intermediate file containing our sorted\nstrings, but it's still a bit lengthy.\nThere's probably some other ways you can accomplish this process a bit quicker,\nbut instead of going over every possible scenario, let's see how you'd do this\nwith the !! command:\n\nusing the range of strings, run !!sort\n\nYep, that's it.
