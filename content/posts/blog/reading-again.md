I used to love to read. When I was really young I used to love the [*Hardy
Boys*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/HAB/the-hardy-boys/),
[*Guardians of
Ga'Hoole*](https://kathrynlasky.com/book-series/series/guardians-of-gahoole),
and [*Percy Jackson*
series](https://rickriordan.com/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/)[^1].
Reading to me was so much fun because I often felt so connected to the
characters. This is obviously supported by character development and
world-building by the author, but I felt this much more than I did from a good
movie. For example, when I was in elementary school I read [*The
Beasties*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24881.The_Beasties). Even today,
I can remember some of the imagery in that book: a species of underground
creature with crudely-stitched body parts, having translucent skin such that
their veins and muscles were visible. Even today, I can recall how I imagined
this as I read it, and it's as vivid as ever. I think that's part of the magic
of reading a book. You're not recalling a story as a directory intended
visually. Instead, the author provides a foundation and some thin guidelines,
and the reader is left to fill in the picture using their own imagination. This
provides an experience created in collaboration between author and reader. It's
a two-way street.

Fast-forward to high school, and everything changed. Reading assignments were
given each week. Reading, for me, turned from a past time and into a chore. One
where there were consequences for not completing. And this ruined reading for
me. I stopped reading and instead turned to summaries such as
[SparkNotes](https://www.sparknotes.com/) and
[CliffsNotes](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/). I stopped reading for the enjoyment
of it, and started completing weekly reading assignments with a mind-numbingly
mechanical attitude.

And I think there were a couple of reasons for this, ranging from my attitude
towards it to the sort of behavior schoolwork like this incentivizes. But this
discussion is a tangent I don't want to follow here.

The reason I decided to ramble today isn't to take digs at the education system,
or to reveal my work ethic in English and Literature classes, or to suggest
young adult novels. Instead, I wanted to tell you that I started reading again,
and that I'm so happy I did. Last weekend, I picked up a copy of [*Red
Rising*](https://www.piercebrown.com/redrisingsaga), by Pierce Brown on a whim.
I saw an influencer on social media talking about the book and figured, what the
hell, why not? And I'm so glad I did. It revived something in me that I thought
had long since died out.

In the first few chapters, I quickly found myself effortlessly painting a mental
picture of a world Brown was constructing for me with every word. It genuinely
filled me with excitement to keep reading. After finishing a chapter, all I
wanted to do was read the next. And the next. And the next. I'm roughly a third
of the way into the first installment in the series, and I can't wait to learn
how the story progresses. I'm even more thrilled that when this story ends, more
are waiting for me.

If you're like me and think you lost your love of reading or disenchanted by
the lack of good storytelling, you should pick up *Red Rising*. It just might
reignite that spark. I know it did for me.

[^1]: It's funny - the *Percy Jackson* movie(s) was one of the first time I
    remember a film studio butchering a book.
