The best color scheme is a hotly-debated topic. And for good reason! Lots of
talented people put together some really good-looking color schemes, including:
- [Nord](https://github.com/nordtheme/nord)
- [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme)
- [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)
- [One Dark](https://github.com/one-dark/onedark.nvim)
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim)

This is, by no means, an exhaustive list. I've used each of these in the past
and really enjoyed each one. However, I never really felt at-home with them.

*Enter [Gruvbox](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim)*.

There's something so supremely, comfortably satisfying about Gruvbox. The
assignment of colors to code constructs *just makes sense*™. Keywords in red.
Functions in green. Types in yellow. Fields and variables in white. Parameters
in blue. The harmony of colors and how they represent various elements in source
code is perfectly balanced, so much so that anything else looks sub par. I feel
like I can skim through code using these colors to find important landmarks such
as function definitions effortlessly, even without really reading the code.
[Treesitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) deserves some of this
praise too for its semantic highlighting capabilities that allow the color
scheme to integrate more closely with each language.

I recently tried to switch to the
[Melange](https://github.com/savq/melange-nvim) color scheme. Melange is another
warm color scheme inspired by Gruvbox. I did enjoy using it, and it does look
very good. However, I just didn't feel as productive with it. It felt like I had
to expend more energy and brainpower to navigate complex code without my usual
colored landmarks. This only lasted about a week before I came crawling back to
Gruvbox. There's nothing wrong with Melange, it's just... not Gruvbox.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, of course, but if your opinion is not
*"Gruvbox is the best color scheme"*, I'm sorry to say, you're wrong. Gruvbox is
the greatest color scheme of all time... *my beloved Gruvbox*.
