Hi there! Since you landed here on the _about_ page I guess I should tell you a
little bit about myself.

In my free time I enjoy learning new programming languages and learning new
things about the ones I already know [^1]. I like reinventing the wheel and
implementing existing ideas from scratch. I also make small contributions to
open-source projects. My favorite programming language is C.

[^1]: The more I learn, the less I feel like I know. I don't think there's a
single programming language I know absolutely everything about. That's why I
love this kind of work--every day is a new challenge.
